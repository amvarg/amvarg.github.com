        <p>The article we looked at this week is linked <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">here.</a> It was mainly focused upon touch screen, mobile-based games. The article still had a lot of really good insights on best UX practices for game design</p>

        <p>I learned to keep comfort-to-reach and hard-to-reach areas in mind when designing. Sliders are also a useful tool when trying to display additional content that may not fit within the display window. I also learned to associated visible UI with hidden UI via animations, and to use a semi-transparent background behind popups. </p>

        <p>For draggable items, make sure the anchors are in spots where the entire object is not hidden by the users hand. Intro videos should not be longer than 20 seconds, and should be accessible again. Also, for ratings — ask users for them after achievements, not too early.</p>

    <figcaption>Fig.1 - The Discussed License Plate.</figcaption>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <section class="bodyCopy">
        <p><br><br><br><br>This image is a part of an archive of license plate pictures I have been taking for years. My friends and I always joked about creating a coffee table book from these pictures.This specific license plate was really funny to me, so of course I had to snap a picture.
        </p>

        <p>The context behind this image is that my ex-boyfriend and I were heading to Carpinteria back in April 2019. As we drove up the 126, he spotted this license plate. What exactly is the “mistake” here? The purchase of the car? The owner? It was just funny to think about.
        </p>

        <p>This archive of license plate photos is really just an archive of funny memories. It is really neat to look back at the metadata of each image, which includes locations and dates. Looking for context within my camera roll is also interesting, as I feel like I am piecing together a memory from scattered images. </p>

    <figcaption>Fig.2 - Adam's Horizon Photography.</figcaption>

        <p><br><br><br><br>This image is from my group member, Adam Overmeer. This is a part of a collection of images with matching skies (with the sky taking up the top 50% of the photo!).
        </p>

        <p>I think the most interesting part of the image is the perfectly horizontal horizon. It almost looks like the image has been stretched or edited to create this effect. The contrast between the blue sky and the rest of the image is also a very striking effect. I think it will be super interesting to see the rest of the images in this collection, having that variation in location will be cool to see!
        </p>

        <p>The most obvious aspect of the image is the horizontal focus of the composition, but I think this will become more captivating within the collection. The main mystery here for me is the location and context of each image. </p>

        <p><br><br><br><br><br>I really loved the example I chose (found on Awwwards.com). It is the portfolio of Parisian 3D artist and creative director, Jameen Tarlier. I chose this example mainly because I see myself using this sort of interaction when it comes to my own digital design portfolio. Right now, I just have all of my work displayed statically alongside some brief text describing the project, and I don’t think this is too visually interesting.</p>

        <p>The interactions on Jameen Tarlier’s website are subtle, yet work so flawlessly. As the user hovers over the name of a project, the corresponding image pops up to the right of the name. The user then has the ability to click into the project, if they are more curious about the context of the project. This is a great way for users to get a brief preview of an entire catalog of work, without being led away from the home page several times. </p>

        <p>Modals, or an element that sits on top of an application’s main window, are usually dreaded by users. Most people automatically dismiss these windows. However, they can be useful when grabbing the users attention, getting user input, showing additional information in context, or showing independent, unrelated information.</p>

        <p>However, you do not want to use a modal to show error, success, or warning messages — keep those on the page. Modals also need an escape, whether it is a cancel button, close button, escape key, or clicking outside of the window. This escape must also be keyboard accessible, and keep low-vision users in mind. Modal titles must be descriptive, along with buttons. These names should be actionable, and understandable. Modal sizing must also be just right, the content should fit the modal, and shouldn’t take up the entire screen. </p>

        <p>A lightbox effect (darkening of the background) should be used when opening a modal, and the user should trigger this. Modals should not randomly pop up, since users will get surprised and close it quickly. Also, another thing to keep in mind is that modals don’t usually work well on mobile devices.</p>

        <h1>Learning Journal <br> Best Practices <br> For Form Design</h1>

        <p>After reading Best practices for form design by Salim Ansari, I felt like I had a much  better understanding of usability in the context of web forms.</p>

        <p>When it comes to creating content for a form, make sure you are only asking for the most relevant information. Also try and format the form in one column - if needed, chunking the form into several, labeled steps may increase the likelihood of form completion. Asking complex questions (like credit card information, or social security numbers) should be done towards the end of the form. It is also important to clarify formatting or input requirements, as the user may abandon the form due to lack of instructions. I also learned to avoid generic labels on submission/action buttons, and to disable the action button after a tap so there is no duplicate submission. Post-submission feedback is also quite useful.</p>

        <p>These are just some examples of the tips I learned during the reading. This content will be especially useful as we move forward in the class, and complete our Mad Libs 2.0 project! I am also very excited to start thinking some more about accessibility, and user experience in future working during this class.</p>

        <p>A form that I have interacted with fairly recently is the Reddit.com sign up form. It is very simple. The user can either sign up using google or their apple id, or create an account from scratch through email. The action buttons are clearly labeled, and stand out very well. The user is also given feedback throughout the process. Required fields are made obvious, and there is support text wherever necessary. Although it is a very short, two step process, it is well done. The simplicity, I’m sure, helps with form completion.</p>
