        <p>After reading Best practices for form design by Salim Ansari, I felt like I had a much  better understanding of usability in the context of web forms.</p>

        <p>When it comes to creating content for a form, make sure you are only asking for the most relevant information. Also try and format the form in one column - if needed, chunking the form into several, labeled steps may increase the likelihood of form completion. Asking complex questions (like credit card information, or social security numbers) should be done towards the end of the form. It is also important to clarify formatting or input requirements, as the user may abandon the form due to lack of instructions. I also learned to avoid generic labels on submission/action buttons, and to disable the action button after a tap so there is no duplicate submission. Post-submission feedback is also quite useful.</p>

        <p>These are just some examples of the tips I learned during the reading. This content will be especially useful as we move forward in the class, and complete our Mad Libs 2.0 project! I am also very excited to start thinking some more about accessibility, and user experience in future working during this class.</p>

        <p>A form that I have interacted with fairly recently is the Reddit.com sign up form. It is very simple. The user can either sign up using google or their apple id, or create an account from scratch through email. The action buttons are clearly labeled, and stand out very well. The user is also given feedback throughout the process. Required fields are made obvious, and there is support text wherever necessary. Although it is a very short, two step process, it is well done. The simplicity, Iâ€™m sure, helps with form completion.</p>
