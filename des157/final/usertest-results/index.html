    <h2>Significant Observations From Testing</h2>
    <!-- At least three significant observations that emerged through testing and write 1 - 3 sentences on each. -->
    <p>I met with Miguel, Gennifer, and Mahima to conduct user testing during class. They had lots of great comments that will definitely help me improve my Final Project — here are the three most significant observations:</p>

    <p class="list">1. Allow for more customization options (Examples include adding a date, year, color options, etc).</p>

    <p class="list">2. Make the option to reset more option — maybe make it a button.</p>

    <p class="list">3. Style the form text fields to be different from the default.</p>

    <h2>Plan For Updates</h2>
    <!-- Plan of how you will update your Final Project based on the feedback. -->
    <p>I really enjoyed the conversations I had during my user tests. I feel like I will definitely include the reset button idea — it makes a lot of sense. I also want to include some further customization options, which might make the entire project a bit more dynamic. I also want to play around a bit with styling, and make the overall project more playful.</p>
