    <h1>Final Project - <span id="brief">Brief</span></h1>

    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>I will be updating my first studio project, Mad Libs 2.0. I really love the idea behind the project — a concert poster generator. My intentions are to really further the visual design, and edit it until I am 100% happy with it. Right now, I'm about 80% happy with it! </p>

    <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
    <p>I took a look at a website called postermywall.com. It has a similar idea — generating concert posters based upon user input. The design of the website itself is pretty user friendly, the editor allowing for quite a large amount of user customization in the layout itself. There is the ability to click and drag items around, which is super interesting, but is an idea that doesn’t really work in the context of my project. I think there should be some more design constraints within the project — users in this case should not have this level of freedom.</p>

    <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
    <p>I also took a look at madtakes.com. This website is your basic mad libs type of site. I thought the user interface lacked any sort of visual design interest, with an aesthetic clearly stuck within the early 2000s. However, the site worked just like I expected it to, and I was able to create some funny mad-lib stories. I think that the presentation of the end result mad-lib story could be improved, possibly putting it in a layout that mimics the styling of a book. That could be fun!</p>

    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <p>My project, in comparison to the first mentioned website, is similar in the idea of generating a poster. However, it is not meant to be a design tool, which PosterMyWall is. My project, when compared to the second mentioned site, is similar in the concept of the mad-libs game, but that is pretty much it. My project focuses a lot more on the final visual layout, rather than just outputting the words. My goals are to finalize the visual design, possibly add more options for the user, and to incorporate some feedback from my peers and instructors. I’d also like to maybe do some user testing, if I get the chance!</p>

    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project is to feel quite 60s/early 70s inspired. I will be using quite neutral tones, except when it comes to the poster itself. There is a focus on balance and hierarchy within the poster, so if I do decide to include additional elements, this must be taken into account!</p>

    <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
    <p>I’d like to include some time-based behaviors, possibly for the background of the project, or even in the gradient of the poster. I think this would be interesting. I also think including some more hover effects may improve the user experience overall</p>

    <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
    <p>The intended experience is for the user to really enjoy the aesthetics of the late 60s/early 70s. I plan on achieving this mainly through visual updates, but I am also playing around with the idea of incorporating some audio clips -— either as sound effects, or music that is meant to match up with the poster itself.
