    <h1>Project Brief</h1>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p> I'm looking to focus upon the idea of generations in the format of a desktop website; My intentions are to
        highlight the different ways that people define their own generations.
    </p>
    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <p>My goals for this project are to incorporate a drag and drop ability, and potentially the ability for users to save images from my site.</p>
    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
    <p> I really appreciate the Brutalist design approach. I think it is modern, and jarring, which is something I am trying to achieve for this project. The usage of bolded sans-serifs, bright colors, and chaotically layered images encourage people of all ages to rearrange until they feel accurately represented. </p>
    <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
    <p> I plan on lots of drag and drop interactions (an interactive collage). I love the idea of time based behaviors, particularly a time-based introduction chunk of text. I also would like users to interact with this collage, rearrange and create something they feel is the definition of their generation, and to be able to save it for their own usage. The idea of music that can be interacted with is also incredibly interesting to me â€” possibly some sort of Spotify inclusion.
    </p>
    <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
    <p> I want users to really do some introspection, and look back upon the way they were raised, and the era they experienced chldhood in. They should be prompted to think about the definition of their particular generation, and I hope my project sparks this sort of thinking within them. </p>
