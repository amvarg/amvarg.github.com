            <p id="evaIllouz">
                Cold Intimacies: The Making of Emotional Capitalism by Eva Illouz has been my favorite book I've found
                at the RCA yet. Although dated (written in 2007.....LOL at the fact that this is already dated! Who is
                even using e-harmony anymore? I thought we all moved onto Hinge?), I found it really relevant to the
                topics I'm exploring, and in-line with my personal experiences. The section of the book titled "Romantic
                Webs" has several chapters surrounding self presentation online, virtual meetings, fantasy and
                disappointment, and romance on the internet.

                Illouz's analysis of the way we are expected to focus intensely on ourselves, our supposed interests,
                and self-ideals in order to present ourselves "accurately" online is incredibly interesting. People will
                attempt to break themselves out from the monotony of similar profiles they're being pinned against —
                Illouz wording this as "one's sense of uniqueness [...] being sharpened by the Internet dating sites".
                The monotony, however, stems from wanting to appeal to as many people as possible — the "cultural
                scripts of the desirable personality".

                The self has become a "commodity on public display"; <strong>entirely departing from the traditional
                    perception
                    of love and attraction and placing people into an intense competition with others. </strong>Love,
                historically,
                has been presented as somewhat unexpected and spontaneous, and linked to sexual attraction. "Love" was
                scarce. Dating apps and internet-initiated relationships have changing this almost entirely, allowing
                for another level of pickiness within a new, structured market.
                <br>
                <br>
                The following quotes from Illouz really stood out to me — and might as well have sparked the interest
                for the rest of my project: "Romantic relations are not only organized within the market, but have
                themselves become commodities produced on an assembly line, to be consumed fast, efficiently, cheaply,
                and in great abundance. [...] The internet seems to bring the process of rationalization of emotions and
                love to levels not dreamed of by critical theorists".
            </p>
            <p>Here are some quotes from the book:
                <br>
                <br>
                “The internet is presented as a disembodying technology and positively so, in the sense that the movie
                relies on the idea that the self is better revealed and more authentic when presented outside the
                constraints of bodily interactions” p.75
                <br>
                <br>
                <!-- add a transition here -->
                “If the internet annuls or brackets the body, how then can it shape, if at all, emotions? more exacly,
                how does technology rearticulate corporality and emotions?” p.75
            </p>
            <hr>

            <p id="debLup">Deborah Lupton's was also quite integral to my research. She speaks about the concept of
                building up self-perception, in particular through the tracking of various statistics associated with
                your health and wellbeing. It's quite interesting, as it ties into technological advances in recent
                years that allow for even more specific sorts of tracking; to quote Lupton directly — "self tracking
                beliefs and practices may be viewed as simply one approach among the many that have been used across the
                milennia to control, manage, regulate, perform, and express embodiment" (p.51). This concept of needing
                external validation to perceive and validate oneself is the most interesting notion of her writing, as I
                can see where it can potentially link back to external relationships. </p>
            <p> "In some contexts, engaging in self-optimization or enhancement is even demanded of people (for example,
                public health campaigns exhort people to give up smoking or lose weight" (p.48). This is an example of
                what could be an external relationship with self-optimization could be; but besides a public health
                campaign, <strong>interpersonal relationships in the digital age rely quite a bit on at least one of the
                    parties
                    being able to describe themselves.</strong> Whether the description and self perception is
                accurately displayed
                is up to the honesty of the user, but that's what makes this entire concept intriguing. We learn quite a
                bit about ourselves purely through the form of feedback.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p id="jarLan">I also began to read through some of Jaron Lanier's "You Are Not A Gadget". Coming into the
                library, I knew I wanted to focus in on finding literature surrounding our current relationship to
                technology, and the direct effect of it on our interpersonal relationships. Lanier's book is somewhat of
                a manifesto, commenting on how the internet has created a <strong>"widespread practice of fragmentary,
                    impersonal communication" that has "demeaned interpersonal interaction".</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                He briefly touches upon how my generation shares every detail of our lives across social media platforms
                — blaming it on a need to "avoid the closed door at bedtime, the empty room, the screaming vacuum of an
                isolated mind". I was really taken aback by this accusation; especially in knowing that it hits so close
                to home. Another piece of Lanier's manifesto that stood out to me was the following quote: "the deep
                meaning of personhood is being reduced by illusions of bits". This made me think quite a bit about the
                way that we present ourselves on social media, dating apps, or just online in general — we have entirely
                reduced ourselves to the outwardly most "interesting" bits of personality; which in turn, I believe
                could be reducing our actual personalities and ways we expect people to act around us. .

            <p id="marAik">Mary Aiken's The Cyber Effect was what really created the link between all of my research on
                the 21st century relationship, the idea of confession within cult and religious contexts, and the
                results from their interaction. <br>To quote her directly: "online, the courtship ritual continues in an
                exchange of texts, email, or chatroom posts, each more intimate than the last — which <strong>can make
                    cyberspace feel like a journey to the confessional box</strong>" (p.208).</p>
            <p>"Confession" and "confessional work" had already come up more than once throughout my reading, Aiken
                further explaining this need to share with virtual strangers as a paradox called the "<strong>stranger
                    on the train syndrome,</strong> because it is a proven reality that people can feel more comfortable
                disclosing personal information to someone that they may never see again" (p.208). There's less of an
                emotional risk of being hurt by a romantic interest or partner that has never met you in real life;
                there's more opportunity to feel less judged and to feel less vulnerable when stripping back the
                relationship and making it entirely devoid of face-to-face contact, which in the past has been the
                backbone of any relationship. The internet makes a relationship possible with anyone who has access to a
                computer.

            <hr>
            <p id="traEmi">There's a notion of Emin's work that is heavily discussed here — <strong>her identity, age,
                    and
                    gender potentially leading her work to be  read in a more confessional manner;</strong> in
                particular the work
                she has surrounding intimate relationships. There is also an urgency found throughout a lot of her work,
                which helps transmit a certain sense of exposure of emotion. The authors discuss this, linking her
                visuals with this more urgent, hurried form of production. 

                I really loved the way that Emin's work was described as self reflective, yet simultaneously a
                representation of the "social whole". This is a goal I wish to achieve as I explore a more confessional
                approach to my work; I want to have my practice be more personal, yet I want to make sure that other
                people have some sort of response to it, no matter what it may be. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Here are some additional quotes I pulled from the book:
                <br>
                <br>
                “Where the work of an older or male artists might be read less confesionally, Emin’s age and gender,
                combined with her thematization of initimate relations and artistic production, make her a spectacular
                emblem of her own oeuvre.” (p.7)
                <br>
                <br>
                “The work is urgent, quick in its transmission of emotion, and part of its urgency seems to derive
                from hurried production” (p.11)
                <br>
                <br>
                ”Betterton’s analysis of the ways in which Emin makes the personal political - without her ever
                overtly arguing that it is political - and study of her mediating strategies - the sewn, the handcrafted
                - demonstrates continuities between the yBa generation and a now largely neglected group of British
                women artists of the previous two decades.”(p.12)
                <br>
                <br>
                ”Shimmering multiple portrait — simultaneously signifier of self, reflective representation of the
                social whole, and exemplar of the reflectivity of the artwork” (p.13)
                <br>
                <br>
                ”Reiterates passages of her life history thru a reflective medium that seems to communicate with the
                immediacy of the drawing, but which in reality demands a degree of preparedness and
                self-awareness”(p.15)
                <br>
                <br>
                “...if we wish to go beyond the immediate sensation and affect of its popular reception, is to ask what
                degree intimacy here is itself an aesthetic strategy, a cause, rather than simply a condition or effect,
                of the artwork”(p.15)
                <br>
                <br>
                ”Even though emin’s work would suggest she’s having the worst time imaginable, hers - and by
                association her spectator’s - is an art and a life predicated upon the possibility of pleasure, figured
                through corporeal experience that confirms individual subjectivity”(p.15)
                <br>
                <br>
                “But her work consciously reworks her “life story” as a set of narratives and memories. she
                produces her life as a series of texts in a deliberately unrefined autobiographical form, aiming at
                immediacy and intimacy in relation to herself and her early sexual experiences” (p.27)
                <br>
                <br>
                “Emin’s work is a form of ‘self-life drawing; or purposeful reconstruction of the past as a set of
                stories, rather than the ‘truth’ of a life”(p.33)

            <p id="cathSh">This book was actually one of the hardest to source during initial research. I knew that
                after reading so much about Tracey Emin and Mary Aiken's The Cyber Effect, that I wanted to explore the
                gap surrounding confession. My background is Catholic, so I knew how powerful this concept could be for
                some people, and how much influence it might hold on my own practice.
                <br>
                <br>
                I ended up finding this for 1GBP at a bookstore in Brixton; an entire chapter of it dedicated to
                confession. It explains how Catholics perceive confession and absolution, and how it physically works.
                My main interest here was the notion of having to confess your sins to an entire stranger; your entire
                trust relying on the fact that they were appointed by a higher being.
                <br>
                <br>
                Growing up, my concern was always that human nature would get the best of the priest, and he'd tell all
                of my secrets not just to God, but to my mom waiting on the other side of the confessional door. I never
                found it possible to be truly and entirely truthful — a sense of guilt overtaking my entire childhood.
                Would I never reach absolution?
                <br>
                <br>
                This also informed a lot of the "making" and "experimentation" I conducted for this portion of the
                project; My grandma creating a little booklet for me as a young girl, with the names of all 7 deadly
                sins within them. I was expected to fill each page out as I sinned, not holding anything back. This was
                even more stressful, as there was not even an implication of secrecy in this form of confesssion; it was
                going all straight to her. This was an inspiration for the zine project I've started below.

                    has been done since last we confessed. Every confession is a conversion back to God, telling him we

                <strong>i must be somebody else you've known </strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                there’s an
                <br>
                <br>
                innate need to share, let me know why
                it's not like you’ve cared to begin with
                <br>
                <br>
                small screen clutched to your body as you sleep,
                those you’ve left in that web send
                ceaseless greetings without a clue
                of the overly warmed body beneath you
                and to your right until the morning
                <br>
                <br>
                no need to make it more of a thing
                to validate past what it's become
                the tracks you choose to open our eyes to
                seem to speak for themselves
                <br>
                <br>
                but your actual explanation is casual, unbothered
                bareboned confession is your specialty
                <br>
                <br>
                but what is confession
                without the aims of absolution?
                <br>
                <br>
                do you just find anyone who will listen
                to take you in
                more ways than one
                <br>
                <br>
                asking how to spell
                for your own sake
                to camouflage a new reality
                without a surname
                <br>
                <br>
                is it pathetic you won’t even write my name
                with actual ink?
                <br>
                <br>
                you couldn’t write what you do to me?
                <br>
                <br>
                wouldn’t that make you feel better?
                <br>
                <br>

                it’s kind of on me this time
                id argue
                <br>
                <br>
                mixed signals are easy to give
                when you’re south with your friends
                i’ll never meet
                <br>
                <br>
                last minute move
                i question on the walk back
                looking through my own glossary
                of potential engagements
                that might suit me better than
                your proposal
                <br>
                <br>
                you’ll never meet mine either
                but they’re keen to make sure we do
                at least once
                <br>
                <br>
                its funny how easy it is to tell
                when you’re looking right through me
                it's not like anything i say matters anyways
                small talk in a budget bar you didn’t offer to pay for
                <br>
                <br>
                my confession is embarrassing to admit to him
                as its involving someone like you, to be fair
                <br>
                <br>
                there’s no connection made through talking about
                the same bands everyone knows for the lesser part of an hour
                why'd you expect anything more than a kiss?
                <br>
                <br>
                i’ve made this mistake before
                of following through and through
                <br>
                <br>
                splitting myself like that just won’t work again
                i just hope he looked away this one time
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>why do my friends always gasp when i tell them about you
                </strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                they all have one just like i do
                so i never really understood the confusion
                when i’d tell them about you smile on my face
                <br>
                <br>
                what do you mean you never told someone else about the
                deepest pits of your being
                <br>
                <br>
                especially when we know He is so eager
                <br>
                <br>
                to hear from you and your own
                and those horrible things you do
                <br>
                <br>
                scrawl it in a book
                much like the one you fashioned for me
                your handwriting as letterheads
                to remind me of who this is all really for
                <br>
                <br>
                I can't help it; I'm human, am I right?
                a prompt to recall the nature of my sins
                <br>
                <br>
                why does it work in the way that
                the only one to beg for absolution
                in my first grade class
                <br>
                <br>
                is a little girl with too much shame
                flushing herself out to please you? <br>
