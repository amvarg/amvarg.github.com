            <p id="evaIllouz">
                Cold Intimacies: The Making of Emotional Capitalism by Eva Illouz has been my favorite book I've found
                at the RCA yet. Although dated (written in 2007.....LOL at the fact that this is already dated! Who is
                even using e-harmony anymore? I thought we all moved onto Hinge?), I found it really relevant to the
                topics I'm exploring, and in-line with my personal experiences. The section of the book titled "Romantic
                Webs" has several chapters surrounding self presentation online, virtual meetings, fantasy and
                disappointment, and romance on the internet.

                Illouz's analysis of the way we are expected to focus intensely on ourselves, our supposed interests,
                and self-ideals in order to present ourselves "accurately" online is incredibly interesting. People will
                attempt to break themselves out from the monotony of similar profiles they're being pinned against —
                Illouz wording this as "one's sense of uniqueness [...] being sharpened by the Internet dating sites".
                The monotony, however, stems from wanting to appeal to as many people as possible — the "cultural
                scripts of the desirable personality".

                The self has become a "commodity on public display"; entirely departing from the traditional perception
                of love and attraction and placing people into an intense competition with others. Love, historically,
                has been presented as somewhat unexpected and spontaneous, and linked to sexual attraction. "Love" was
                scarce. Dating apps and internet-initiated relationships have changing this almost entirely, allowing
                for another level of pickiness within a new, structured market.
                <br>
                <br>
                The following quotes from Illouz really stood out to me — and might as well have sparked the interest
                for the rest of my project: "Romantic relations are not only organized within the market, but have
                themselves become commodities produced on an assembly line, to be consumed fast, efficiently, cheaply,
                and in great abundance. [...] The internet seems to bring the process of rationalization of emotions and
                love to levels not dreamed of by critical theorists".
            </p>
            <p>Here are some quotes from the book:
                <br>
                <br>
                “The internet is presented as a disembodying technology and positively so, in the sense that the movie
                relies on the idea that the self is better revealed and more authentic when presented outside the
                constraints of bodily interactions” p.75
                <br>
                <br>
                <!-- add a transition here -->
                “If the internet annuls or brackets the body, how then can it shape, if at all, emotions? more exacly,
                how does technology rearticulate corporality and emotions?” p.75
            </p>

            <p id="debLup">Deborah Lupton's was also quite integral to my research. She speaks about the idea of
                building up your self-perception.</p>
            <hr>
            <p id="jarLan">I also began to read through some of Jaron Lanier's "You Are Not A Gadget". Coming into the
                library, I knew I wanted to focus in on finding literature surrounding our current relationship to
                technology, and the direct effect of it on our interpersonal relationships. Lanier's book is somewhat of
                a manifesto, commenting on how the internet has created a "widespread practice of fragmentary,
                impersonal communication" that has "demeaned interpersonal interaction"
                <br>
                <br>
                He briefly touches upon how my generation shares every detail of our lives across social media platforms
                — blaming it on a need to "avoid the closed door at bedtime, the empty room, the screaming vacuum of an
                isolated mind". I was really taken aback by this accusation; especially in knowing that it hits so close
                to home. Another piece of Lanier's manifesto that stood out to me was the following quote: "the deep
                meaning of personhood is being reduced by illusions of bits". This made me think quite a bit about the
                way that we present ourselves on social media, dating apps, or just online in general — we have entirely
                reduced ourselves to the outwardly most "interesting" bits of personality; which in turn, I believe
                could be reducing our actual personalities and ways we expect people to act around us. .

            <p>Here are some quotes from the book:
                <br>
                <br>
                ”...Widespread practice of fragmentary, impersonal communication has demeaned interpersonal interaction”
                p. 4
                <br>
                <br>
                “The deep meaning of personhood is being reduced by illusions of bits” p. 20
                <br>
                <br>
                ”If you love a medium made of software, there’s a danger that you will become entrapped in someone
                else’s recent careless thoughts” p. 22
                <br>
                <br>
                ”A computer isnt even there unless a person experiences it” p. 26
                <br>
                <br>
                ”If we are only able to be approximately moral, that doesn’t mean we should give up trying to be
                moral at all” p. 39
                <br>
                <br>
                ”Young people announce every detail of their lives on services like twitter not to show off, but to
                avoid the closed door at bedtime, the empty room, the screaming vacuum of an isolated mind” p. 180

                <br>
                its funny how easy it is to tell
                when you’re looking right through me
                it's not like anything i say matters anyways
                small talk in a budget bar you didn’t offer to pay for
                <br>
                <br>
                my confession is embarrassing to admit to him
                as its involving someone like you, to be fair
                <br>
                <br>
                there’s no connection made through talking about
                the same bands everyone knows for the lesser part of an hour
                why'd you expect anything more than a kiss?
                <br>
                <br>
                i’ve made this mistake before
                of following through and through
                <br>
                <br>
                splitting myself like that just won’t work again
                i just hope he looked away this one time
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>why do my friends always gasp when i tell them about you
                </strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                they all have one just like i do
                so i never really understood the confusion
                when i’d tell them about you smile on my face
                <br>
                <br>
                what do you mean you never told someone else about the
                deepest pits of your being
                <br>
                <br>
                especially when we know He is so eager
                <br>
                <br>
                to hear from you and your own
                and those horrible things you do
                <br>
                <br>
                scrawl it in a book
                much like the one you fashioned for me
                your handwriting as letterheads
                to remind me of who this is all really for
                <br>
                <br>
                I can't help it; I'm human, am I right?
                a prompt to recall the nature of my sins
                <br>
                <br>
                why does it work in the way that
                the only one to beg for absolution
                in my first grade class
                <br>
                <br>
                is a little girl with too much shame
                flushing herself out to please you? <br>
                <br>
